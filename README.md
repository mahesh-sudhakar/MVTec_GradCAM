# MVTec_GradCAM

Grad-CAM[1] implementation on [MVTec anomaly AD dataset](https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad/)[2] re-casted into a supervised learning based classification task.

Code for training a ResNet101 model using Transfer Learning is also provided in this repo, as the trained model is loaded onto the Grad-CAM explanation algorithm.
